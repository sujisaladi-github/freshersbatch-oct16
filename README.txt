---An assignment folder is a folder that "students" have access to record and upload their own videos/sound bites to. 
Students within a class have the ability to record and upload videos to the assignment folder once it has been created. 
- There are additional settings to allow students to only see their own or the entire classes uploaded recordings.  Additional assignments folders can be created and closed out as often as an instructor finds useful.
